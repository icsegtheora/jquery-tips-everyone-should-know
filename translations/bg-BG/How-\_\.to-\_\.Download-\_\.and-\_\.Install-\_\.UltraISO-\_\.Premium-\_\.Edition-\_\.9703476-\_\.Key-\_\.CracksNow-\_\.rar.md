UltraISO is a versatile tool that can handle various types of CD and DVD image formats, such as ISO, BIN/CUE, Nero (NRG), Alcohol 120% (MDS/MDF), and CloneCD (CCD/IMG/SUB) formats. You can use UltraISO to directly edit an ISO file, add or delete files and folders from it, or extract its contents to your hard disk. You can also use UltraISO to create a new ISO file from files and folders on your computer, or from a CD/DVD-ROM. UltraISO can also help you make your ISO file bootable, which means you can use it to start your computer from a CD or DVD.
 
One of the most useful features of UltraISO is its ability to emulate ISO images with virtual CD/DVD drives. This means you can mount an ISO file as a virtual drive on your computer and access its contents without burning it to a physical disc. This can save you time and money, as well as protect your discs from scratches and damage. You can mount up to 8 virtual drives with UltraISO and switch between them easily. You can also use UltraISO to create virtual audio CDs from MP3, WAV, or WMA files.
 
UltraISO has a user-friendly interface that allows you to perform various tasks with ease. You can drag and drop files and folders between the windows, use keyboard shortcuts, or access the menus and toolbars. UltraISO also supports multiple languages and has a built-in help file that explains its functions and features. UltraISO is compatible with Windows 10/8.1/8/7/Vista/XP and requires at least 10 MB of free disk space for installation.
